PREFACE:
What is currently published is the previos iteration of this project I have since begun reworking and refactoring. In otherwords I have taken a few steps back to take some more forward. As you may notice this program as it is now isn't usable. As such keep that in mind while looking through. This is my biggest project yet and even at this stage it is what I am proudest of and it will without a doubt take a lot more time.

All that said feel free to poke around!


README:
This is a solo project of mine where I am trying to create a basic Game Engine.

It is not planned to be a massive high level engine such as unity or unreal but rather one that I can use instead of rewriting the engine every time I make a game that I wish to build without the help of a big game engine (whether it's for having more control or simply for pride).

If this is public (as I'm writing this it is barely even started much less public) feel free to use according to the license (if there is one if not I only ask you place somewhere in the credits/description that it is built with DGE).


Much love!
